# Computação Natural - Deep Reinforcement Learning
University project for Natural Computing in Python - course of Computer Engineering at University of Minho.

## So, what is this?
This project involves the development of a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to create an agent able to play the Breakout game from the Atari 2600 console.

Made in a Python enviroment with help of the OpenAI Gym library and TensorFlow. The Deep Q-Learning network training gets an input (current state of the game)
and outputs the predicted Q-Values by the model for each possible action. After training there's a testing and optimization phase to get the best possible result.
